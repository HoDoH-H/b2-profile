            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my internship report blog. This section outlines my professional experience at Edumotiv, located in Lyon.</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> My internship lasted from June 9th 2025 to August 1st 2025.</p>
            <p><strong>Why This Company?</strong> I chose Edumotiv because their project aligned very well with my career goals. My objectives were to get hands-on with a real projects and to surpass myself with very specific demands and task from real clients.</p>
            <p>Through this experience, I aimed to develop my ability to make well constructed scripts and feature in low time while debugging new and older features, understand and improve core systems in a meaningful way, all while thinking my code to as malleable as possible, and lastly to contribute meaningfully to the organization.</p>
